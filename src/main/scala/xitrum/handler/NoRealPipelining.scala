/**
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining
 *
 * Xitrum does not support real pipelining. A client may send multiple requests,
 * but Xitrum will not process them at concurrently. Xitrum will process one
 * by one.
 *
 * From Mongrel2 doc: http://mongrel2.org/manual/book-finalch6.html
 *
 * "Where problems come in is with pipe-lined requests, meaning a browser sends
 * a bunch of requests in a big blast, then hangs out for all the responses.
 * This was such a horrible stupid idea that pretty much everone gets it wrong
 * and doesn't support it fully, if at all. The reason is it's much too easy to
 * blast a server with a ton of request, wait a bit so they hit proxied backends,
 * and then close the socket. The web server and the backends are now screwed
 * having to handle these requests which will go nowhere."
